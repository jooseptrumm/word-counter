The United Farmers of Canada was a radical farmers organization.
It was established in 1926 as the United Farmers of Canada (Saskatchewan Section) as a merger of the Farmers' Union of Canada
and the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association.[1]
The name "United Farmers" came from the movements that'd been established and run for election,
in some cases taking power, in several provinces such as the United Farmers of Ontario,
the United Farmers of Alberta and federally as the Progressive Party of Canada.
The UFC campaigned in the late 1920s for a "100% pool system"
in which the government would market all grainâ€“
an idea that was ultimately adopted in part in 1935
with the creation of the 'Canadian Wheat Board'
and also operated educational programs for farmers and called for reforms in the health care system and education.[1]
