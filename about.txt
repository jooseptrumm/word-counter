The word-counter program reads the text contents of a file,
counts each unique word and outputs an alphabetic list,
with each word's number of occurrences in the file shown as a numeric value.


The app is written in TypeScript with Node.js.
It is run from the command line using ts-node,
which compiles TypeScript to JavaScript directly at runtime.
TypeScript written specifically for Node.js is supported by the @types/node module.

The text content is extracted from files by the textract package,
to which the module @types/textract provides TypeScript support.

The tests are written with Jest,
with the ts-jest and @types/jest package ensuring compatibility with TypeScript.


The app is able to read the following types of files (from the textract documentation):

HTML, HTM
ATOM, RSS
Markdown
EPUB
XML, XSL
DOCX
XLS, XLSX, XLSB, XLSM, XLTX
CSV
ODS, OTS
PPTX, POTX
ODP, OTP
ODG, OTG
application/javascript
All text/* mime-types.

The app is designed to work specifically with texts written in English or Estonian.
Text in other languages may not be correctly processed by the app.
However, many common foreign-language patterns are still supported.
